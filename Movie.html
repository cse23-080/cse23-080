                   <p>HD 2024 | 121m</p>
                   <p>"Cabrini" is a horror film that revolves around the urban legend of the Candyman. It serves as a sequel to the 1992 film "Candyman" and is directed by Nia DaCosta. The movie is set in the Cabrini-Green neighborhood of Chicago, known for its history of violence and urban decay.

The plot follows an artist named Anthony McCoy, played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who becomes obsessed with the legend of the Candyman while researching for his next art exhibition. As Anthony delves deeper into the myth, he unknowingly awakens the vengeful spirit of the Candyman, a hook-handed killer who haunts those who dare to summon him by saying his name five times in front of a mirror.

As the Candyman's presence grows stronger, a wave of violence and chaos descends upon Cabrini-Green, and Anthony finds himself trapped in a nightmarish spiral of terror. The film explores themes of gentrification, racial injustice, and the power of folklore in shaping collective memory.

"Cabrini" received praise for its atmospheric cinematography, thought-provoking themes, and chilling performances, particularly from Abdul-Mateen II. It has been celebrated as a worthy successor to the original "Candyman" while also offering a fresh perspective on the enduring legacy of the urban legend.</p>
